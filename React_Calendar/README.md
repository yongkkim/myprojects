## React Calendar

This is a calendar with ability to schedule plans using React.

You won't feel difficult to use the calendar with user friendly UI.

You can click year and month to change them.

You can click one of days to set your to-do plans.

In a page for each day, you can type in your to-do and you can simply delete or clear them by clicking each one or clear button.

If you finish setting your to-dos, background color of the day will be changed
and you can mouse over the day to either delete the to-dos or view them to make some changes

Once you make to-dos, cookies will be created and store your data so that 
you can check and track them even after closing a browserand re-starting this application.

Any idea and feedbck are always welcome. If you have any, please contact me via email ykkim6@hotmail.com

Thank you for using this application.
